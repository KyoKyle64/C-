Write a Modular Program that accepts up to 20 integers of quizzes (or test scores) in the range of 0 to 100 from the user and stores them in an array. Then main should report how many perfect scores were entered. (i.e. scores of 100), using a value-returning countPerfect function to help it.
TIP: You may use the following function prototypes:

int getScores(int[]);
int countPerfect(int[], int);

/* SAMPLE RUN RESULTS
 
This program will allow you to enter up to 20 scores
and will then report how many perfect scores were entered.
 
Enter a score 0 - 100 (or -1 to quit): 88
Enter a score 0 - 100 (or -1 to quit): 93
Enter a score 0 - 100 (or -1 to quit): 100
Enter a score 0 - 100 (or -1 to quit): 79
Enter a score 0 - 100 (or -1 to quit): 82
Enter a score 0 - 100 (or -1 to quit): 96
Enter a score 0 - 100 (or -1 to quit): 100
Enter a score 0 - 100 (or -1 to quit): 93
Enter a score 0 - 100 (or -1 to quit): 86
Enter a score 0 - 100 (or -1 to quit): 91
Enter a score 0 - 100 (or -1 to quit): -1
 
The 10 scores you entered include 2 perfect scores.
